# Vanilla-JS Code Challenge Repository

This repository was created for the Nomad Coders Vanilla-JS Code Challenge. The project includes the following features:

## Project Overview

- **Technologies Used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.
- **Real-time Clock**: Displays the current time in real-time.
- **Login and To-do List**: Uses local storage to manage login functionality and a to-do list.
- **Random Background Image**: Displays random background images.
- **Weather and Location Information**: Utilizes the Geolocation API to provide current location and weather information.
- **Persistent Data with Local Storage**: Stores user input data such as name, main goal, and to-do list items to maintain them across sessions.

## Key Features

- **User Login**: Users can enter their name at the start to log in, and the name is saved in local storage to personalize the experience.
- **Weather Information**: Click the weather icon located at the top right corner to open a weather window displaying current weather details based on the userâ€™s location.
- **To-do List**: Click the "Tasks" button at the bottom right corner to open the to-do list interface, where you can add new tasks through an input field. The tasks are stored in local storage, allowing you to maintain your to-do list across sessions.
- **Main Goal**: The main goal can be set in the center of the screen. It is stored in local storage, so your goal remains saved for your next visit.

This project is focused on learning and applying various JavaScript features through a hands-on coding challenge. By interacting with the interface, users can experience real-time updates, persistent data management, and dynamic content updates.
